## Project_1 - Titanic_Passengers_Survival_Prediction

In this project I have build the predictive machine learning model ðŸ“Š which predicts the survival of passengers from Titanic disaster. ðŸš¢

I have try to answer the following questions after analyzing this dataset.

* Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc)
* What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
* Where did the passengers come from?
* Who was alone and who was with family?
* What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
* How accurately we can predict the survival of the passenger?
